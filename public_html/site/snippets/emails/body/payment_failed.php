Hello,

Unfortunately your most recent monthly payment for <?php echo $amount . "\n" ?>
for your Language in Motion subscription was declined.
This could be due to a change in your card number
or your card expiring, cancelation of your credit card,
or the bank not recognizing the payment and taking
action to prevent it.

Please update your payment information as soon as possible
by logging in here: https://languageinmotion.jp/login

Sincerely,
Stephen
