Hello,

This is to let you know that your Language in Motion subscription
has been canceled. You will no longer be charged each month
and your payment details have been removed from Language in Motion's
payment service provider.

As a non-subscriber, you still have access to 3 books ("Trolley", 
"The Nose", and "Rashomon" by Akutagawa Ryunosuke).

If you have any questions or concerns, please email me:
<?php echo site()->email() . "\n" ?>

I hope you found your Language in Motion subscription useful!

Sincerely,
Stephen
