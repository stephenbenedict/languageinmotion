# Tips

- After you pull up a definition, click anywhere outside of it to close it.
- For additional word research, try out the free online Japanese dictionary (link: http://www.weblio.jp/ text: Weblio class: btn).

# If you find editorial errors...

Every book has been reviewed multiple times over to ensure each word has an accurate definition. However, I am bound to have slipped up on some. If you find any such editorial errors, let me know and I will try to fix them as soon as possible.
