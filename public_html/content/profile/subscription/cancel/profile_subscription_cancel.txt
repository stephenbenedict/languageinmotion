Title: Cancel your subscription

----

Text: Are you sure you want to cancel your subscription? After canceling, you will no longer have access to all books (you will have access to just 3 books: トロッコ *Trolley*, 鼻 *The Nose*, and 羅生門 *Rashōmon* by Akutagawa Ryūnosuke).

Your vocabulary records for all books will *not* be deleted, so if you feel like subscribing again, you can pick up where you left off.
