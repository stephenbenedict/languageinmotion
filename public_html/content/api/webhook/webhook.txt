Payment_failed_email_subject: Language in Motion: Your most recent invoice payment failed

----

Payment_failed_email_body:

Hi there,

Unfortunately your most recent invoice payment for {$amount} for your Language in Motion subscription was declined. This could be due to a change in your card number or your card expiring, cancelation of your credit card, or the bank not recognizing the payment and taking action to prevent it.

Please update your payment information as soon as possible by logging in here: https://languageinmotion.jp/login

Sincerely,
Stephen
