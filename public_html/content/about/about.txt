Hello, my name is Stephen Benedict. I was born in and grew up in Japan with English as my primary language and Japanese as secondary. I made Language in Motion to satisfy my literary curiosity and at the same time to improve my Japanese.

And here is why I thought others might also find it useful:

While it is obvious that flashcards lack enough context for building up a useful vocabulary, and that reading literature (or any “real” text) is better by far, there are few educational resources that make this enjoyable or accessible. In general, you must attempt reading Japanese literature on your own, usually with a dictionary, pen and paper for notes, and possibly a computer all balanced on your lap as you read one character at a time. Especially when you are used to reading easily in English, this becomes very tedious. It is like wanting to go outside to see a frog hop around in the rain, but then being forced to dissect one with pincers and needles. So enough organs and tissues. I made Language in Motion for those out there (you do exist?) who want to see how words hop and crawl and swim, with a minimum of those pinned lifelessly against a page.
