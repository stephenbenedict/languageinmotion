Dear Language in Motion Users,

Thank you very much for trying out Language in Motion. I hope that through it you have been able to enjoy and learn much from Japanese literature.

Unfortunately, I have some sad news to deliver. In short, LiM will be shutting down in a month from today (on July 13th, Japan time/July 12th, U.S. time). There is no action you need to take. When the site shuts down on July 12/13th, I will delete all user accounts and associated data. If you have an active subscription, you will receive a full refund.

There are two reasons for this decision. The first is that LiM simply isn’t used very much. It will be a year next month (July 4th) since launching LiM, and while a considerable number of people have used it, unfortunately that number is too low to justify the running costs of the website. Nevertheless, I am very grateful for all of you who did come by and have been using it. Partly because of you, I have learned much from researching and preparing the books in the LiM library, more even than by using LiM itself. And that is the second reason for shutting down LiM: that experience of researching and preparing books for LiM has revealed that LiM itself is redundant and unnecessary for enjoying and learning from Japanese literature.

In closing, thank you again. I wish you the best in all of your future readings and studies in Japanese literature. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask by writing me at stephen[at]languageinmotion.jp

Sincerely,
Stephen
